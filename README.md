Awarded 2nd Place in a CX Kaggle Competition.

● Designed a Random Forest Classifier to predict strokes from patient data with a mean absolute error of 0.04071.

● Trained the model by cleaning and class balancing the patient dataset. Created a heatmap to visualize correlation.

● Implemented one hot encoding, bootstrapping, and hyperparameter tuning techniques to minimize model error.
